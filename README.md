# Elysium  
Some random code generated from /dev/urandom . I have no idea what's the purpose of these code.  

Or on a more serious note, I own (or at least used to, for those retards asking for a paid upgrade in a short period of time/switched to subscription based licensed model.) legit licenses for all the softwares listed here and the codes here are merely for the fun of it. Considering supporting the developers first : )
